# Collections

## Sequences

```Lists, Arrays, ListBuffers, ArrayBuffers, String(StringOps)```

## Sets and maps

colleciton.imutable.{Map, Set} are imported implicitly, as defined in Prefef

## Selecting mutable versus immutable collections

It's better to start from immutable.

## Initializing collections

Using class name is ok

## Tuples

like python tuples, we define it with parantheses

Unlike an array or list, a tuple can hold objects with different types.

To access elements of a tuple, you can use method _1 to access the first element, _2 to access the second, and so on
